			<p>This is <em>not</em> a final product. Features and visuals that may be taken for granted in the final productâ€”like a proper shopping cart, more substantial selections, and settings you can fine tuneâ€”may not be present. This allows us to focus our initial developments on what matters the most in this product. In this case, that's communicating the idea of a fleshed out platform for webcam covers.</p>
